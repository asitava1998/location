# location

## Introduction

An academic project for developing a method to improve location finding using Cell Towers. Read through the file `Documentation.pdf` to understand the background behind the project.

## Steps to reproduce the results

* The repository has three files named `app.m`, `app_cell.m` and `app_wifi.m` . The `app_cell.m` contains the code to find the location using the data from the cell towers, the `app_wifi.m` contains the code to find the location utilising the wifi routers and `app.m` combines both of them to give the best possible result.
* Download/Clone this repository.
* If you have Matlab/Octave installed in your system, simply run these files and see the console log for the results.
* The `location_data.xlsx` has some sample data stored. You can modify this data to your own desired location and see the results.
